A simple and robust logger for Go.

## Performance

`clogs` is simpler than the standard library's `log` package and has some mild performance optimizations:

- Utilization of dedicated `append` methods for common types
- Cached time format for logs printed in the same second
- Attempts to reduce allocations by estimating required buffer size

The following benchmark results compare its performance to the standard library's `log` and `slog` packages.
